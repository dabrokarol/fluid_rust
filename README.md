# Rust Fluid Simulation

I'm going to create a fluid simulation in Rust using SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics). This project is still in the making.

## Goals

-   [ ] Implemeting fluid sim algorithms
-   [ ] Visualization using a graphics library 
-   [ ] Interactive controls (mouse hovering)
-   [ ] Performance optimizations
-   [ ] adding interesting maps/boundaries

## Getting Started

### Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Running

```bash
cargo run --release
```
